## This is HTML and CSS coding playground

This code is intended as a reference for my students or anyone who is beginning to learn web technology and wishes to start with a bit more than "hello world" page.

The code is organized into a responsive website in order to highlight basic usage of HTML and CSS tags, attributes and properties, including, but limited:
* html5 tags and attributes
* foreground and background images, sprites
* media queries and responsive layout
* dropdown menu and pure CSS responisve menu
* css3 selectors, properties, transforms, animations
